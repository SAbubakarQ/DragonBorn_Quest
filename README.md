# DragonBorn's Quest
A long time coming. From using Scratch to develop my very first game, this repository contains my first Java based 2D game. 

DragonBorn's Quest is an adventure where the sprite, DragonBorn (you), must venture into the town and seek the treasure hidden amongst the GreyBeards. There are many elements invovled in this project yet the main one being the use of the Model, View, Controller Architecture and expanding it.
